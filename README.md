What about an ehnhancement to [this phonebook](https://github.com/a-schild/inno-thinyldap) ?

noticed in innovaphone forum [here](http://class.innovaphone.com/moodle2/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=20447)

myPBX can [call externals apps with incoming calls](http://wiki.innovaphone.com/index.php?title=Reference11r1:Concept_myPBX#Starting_an_external_application_for_a_call)

this app can deal with the parameters myPBX deliers as output while caling the app.

getting info from the mySQL-table or the phonebook concerning this number  
and show a dialog to put in additional data to save it as new dataset into the phonebook table
should work.
