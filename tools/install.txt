Requirements: installed inno-thinyldap

You need access via ssh (in windows 10 : open commandshell and enter  

ssh root@<Ip of LAP>

will ask for password 

and a possibility to copy,edit files on the webserver (i use winscp for the most part)
-making a parallel folder to get access via port 8080 so http://<Ip of LAP>:8080 show this folder 


add after last line to /etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf (winscp)


   $SERVER["socket"] == ":8080" {
    server.document-root =  "/var/www/tools"
}


make directory /var/wwww/tools (ssh)

mkdir /var/www/tools


--
upload content of webserver to /var/www/tools
- **adminer.php** - tools to handle mysql-databases (replacement for phpmyadmin) just in case needed when fooling around with mysql-user settings
- **editor.php** - tool to edit mysql-tables , enhanced by a little twist to close the browser window by clicking "Abmelden"  
- **askitall.php** - script to get the phonebook as a sql insert-script
- **dbconnect.php** - mysqlconnection, put user password, tablename here
- **dbdisconnect.php** - guess what  
- **index.html** - very simple website to get access to the scripts, don't know if this is needed.  
- **inputdataset.php** - script to input one dataset 
- **updatedataset.php** - script to update one dataset
- **reindex.php** - reindexing tools to reindex the phonebook-table after big changes to keep the index (addressID) small. a remnant of the record-table is still in there.



so not to publish the technical userdata used in the inno-phonebook you should use a user intended for the editor-access
Create a user name addressmaster , password pw4am

use ssh
--
mysql -u root
  CREATE USER 'addressmaster'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'pw4am';
  GRANT ALL ON phonebook_innovaphone.address TO 'addressmaster'@'localhost';
  FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
  exit
--

or if you dare you can grant acces without a password. will make access to the phonebook more userfriendly

use ssh
--
mysql -u root
  CREATE USER 'addresseditor'@'localhost';
  GRANT ALL ON phonebook_innovaphone.address TO 'addresseditor'@'localhost';
  FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
  exit
--
to get access to the mysql-table you can call the editor.php with some parameters
  
http://<IP Of LAP>:8080/editor.php?username=addressmaster&select=address
will ask for a password

http://<IP Of LAP>:8080/editor.php?username=addresseditor&select=address
won't ask for a password

the index.html uses some samples to get access to the mysql-table via editor.php

the app will call the editor.php with keyboard shortcut F3
(access-data in the preferences-file)
