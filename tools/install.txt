Requirements: installed inno-thinyldap, myPBX should be active , Call-List via innovaphone reporting-app

You need access via ssh (in windows 10 (with activated WSL (windows Linux Support) : open commandshell and enter  

ssh root@<Ip of LAP>
will ask for password 

or with Putty dial in a ssh-Session at the <Ip of LAP>, enter username (root, if not changed) and password (iplinux, if not changed)


and a possibility to copy,edit files on the webserver (i use winscp for the most part)  




add after last line to /etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf (winscp)


   $SERVER["socket"] == ":8080" {
    server.document-root =  "/var/www/tools"
}


make directory /var/wwww/tools (ssh)

--- ssh ---

mkdir /var/www/tools
service lighttpd restart

--- ssh ---
after restarting the webserver this folder can be accessed via http://<Ip of LAP>:8080

the port 8080 is an example and used here, you can use another port but have to change this in the related occurrences.

--
upload content of webserver to /var/www/tools
- **adminer.php** - tools to handle mysql-databases (replacement for phpmyadmin) just in case needed when fooling around with mysql-user settings
- **askitall.php** - script to get the phonebook as a sql insert-script
- **calllist.php** - shows call that have no names, can put the phonenumbers in the phonebook and asks more data copncerning the phonenumber
- **dbconnect.php** - mysqlconnection, put user password, tablename here
- **dbdisconnect.php** - guess what  
- **defs.php** - holds preferences concerning the webserver
- **editor.php** - tool to edit mysql-tables , enhanced by a little twist get access to the phonebook-overview page  
- **inputdataset.php** - script to input one dataset 
- **reindex.php** - reindexing tools to reindex the phonebook-table after big changes to keep the index (addressID) small. a remnant of the record-table is still in there.
- **updatedataset.php** - script to update one dataset
- **index.html** - OverviewPage to get access to the PhonebookEditor or Call-List

so not to publish the technical userdata used in the inno-phonebook you should use a user intended for the editor-access
Create a user name addressmaster , password pw4am

use ssh
--
mysql -u root
  CREATE USER 'addressmaster'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'pw4am';
  GRANT ALL ON phonebook_innovaphone.address TO 'addressmaster'@'localhost';
  FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
  exit
--

or if you dare you can grant acces without a password. will make access to the phonebook more userfriendly

use ssh
--
mysql -u root
  CREATE USER 'addresseditor'@'localhost';
  GRANT ALL ON phonebook_innovaphone.address TO 'addresseditor'@'localhost';
  FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
  exit
--
to get access to the mysql-table you can call the editor.php with some parameters
  
http://<IP Of LAP>:8080/editor.php?username=addressmaster&select=address
will ask for a password

http://<IP Of LAP>:8080/editor.php?username=addresseditor&select=address
won't ask for a password

the index.html uses some samples to get access to the mysql-table via editor.php

the app will call the editor.php with keyboard shortcut F3 or Button, Phonebook-Overview-Page Ctrl-F3, and
a helppage F1

--
The Calllist.php can show Callnumbers of calls that have no name at the time of showing the list. It needs access to the postgres database and table innovaphone-reporting. The credentials to get access are stored in the calllist.php itself. You need to change it there if you have changed user and/or Password. 

--
the App loads some access-data from the preference-file gdfm.ini located in the same folder as the app itself (make a folder where you put both in)
If the App is called by myPBX it will pull all Data  (Program gdfmhelper.exe) from the actual phonebook to a local sqlite-database to get quicker access as the app shows proposals for company and firstname if arrow-down is pressed in the respective fields.

myPBX should call the APP with Parameter n:$n, N:$N, I:$I, u:$u, d:"$d", C:$c
and while a call is picked.
